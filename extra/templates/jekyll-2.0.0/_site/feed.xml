Now I work independently as a freelancer/contractor, bringing that same experience directly to people and businesses who need a trusted web development guy in their corner. Someone who cuts through the hype, explains things clearly, and helps you build practical solutions that actually fit your mission and goals. No BS, no pressure—just solid work and honest guidance from someone who&apos;s seen it all.</subtitle></feed>
